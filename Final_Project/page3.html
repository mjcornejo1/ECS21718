                <p>I just recently made the baseball team, we have yet to play our first game but I beleive we are a well balancewd team with good athletes at each postion, condisering how many of us freshman got moved up to JV is a sign that when we get to varsity we can be very good, assuming wee keep grinding.</p>

        <p>The Lane Tech freshman team for basketball was raw, we played around 20-30 games and only lost 2, one due to missed calls at the end, i believe we could be a contender for state when we all are varsity players if we keep that grind going.</p>

      <p>I was the starting middle line backer for Lane Tech, I was then moved around from middle to outside due to injuries on the team, our final record was 4-4, but I am confident we will do much better next season due to our motivation.</p>
